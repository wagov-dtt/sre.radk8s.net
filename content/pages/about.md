# About

Initial goal is reducing cost/effort to run a security focused [Internal Developer Platform](https://internaldeveloperplatform.org) with a small team.

## General approach to secure development and infrastructure management

Aligned with [CISA Secure By Design Principles](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-by-design) - make sure all code and infra is managed in git repos, per repo try to implement the following:

- Code repos should have [codeql](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/introduction-to-code-scanning/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) + [supply chain security (dependabot)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security) + [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/about-secret-scanning) + [grype (containers)](https://github.com/anchore/grype) reporting configured (preference Helm / Terraform IaC artifacts)
- Infrastructure manifests should have [Trivy misconfiguration](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.55/tutorials/misconfiguration/terraform/) reporting configured
  - Deployments should be from infra repos (ideally proxied through [self-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners) using [AWS instance roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) / [Azure managed identities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-configure-managed-identities?pivots=qs-configure-portal-windows-vm) to avoid credential handling and minimise internet exposure of admin interfaces)
  - If deployments still manual/external, introspection and automated commits from a tool like [terraformer](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraformer) required to ensure drift detection and full visibility of assets.

## Training on Cloud Native Infrastructure & Application Development

Aim to medium term (e.g. 1-2 years) go for a formal certification like [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) + Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) + Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Exam Bundle - Linux Foundation - Training](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/cka-ckad-cks-exam-bundle/) .

Free courses:

- [Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies (LFS151) | Linux Foundation Training](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-cloud-infrastructure-technologies/)
- [Introduction to Kubernetes (LFS158) | Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-kubernetes/)
